<h3>Last Lap of my Web development Project</h3>

<p>
    I spent the last week integrating my project from my knowledge i had received when I had done experiments.
    It took a considerable amount of time to learn how the API communicated and it took time for me integrate with my website.
    I was trying out to access Rdio through echonest Website but there was an access error since Rdio was still in prototype and
    i need special Permission apart from the API to use.Future Work would be integrating Rdio so I can avoid few errors.

    Working with CSS was also equally fun . I made every element responsive on its own so it looks good when resized. The navigation bar i made into drop
    down when smaller so its easier for users to see and navigate. I made sure to avoid bootstrap and try out css on my own which took a lot of time 
    to make such elements responsive.
