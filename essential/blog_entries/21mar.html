   I corrected the mistake where my blog link from my home page had to open in a new window instead of in the same page.My project idea is yet to be confirmed by Professor so 
    I will be having a work up coming by Tuesday after it is confirmed. After Class on Friday , I decided to work on SVG and try out experiments on how animation can be made Possible
