<h3>Responsive Web Page</h3>

<p>
    2nd week into Web development and I am already making the elements Responsive :D
</p>

<p>
    This week , I devoted my time in playing around CSS and how I make elements in a webPage Responsive. I picked out HTML elements that
    could be made responsive.
    First I Chose Text and Placed them inside a "div" Tag and on resizing the window , the font kept decreasing to accomodate themselves inside the
    "div" tag. 
    Second I experimented on a Fluid video.On Resizing the Page , the video container kept changing its size to accomodate to the screen size.
    Third I tried out how HTML Tables can be made Responsive with the help of CSS
    And finally I created a Responsive Grid which was the most challenging element of this week.
