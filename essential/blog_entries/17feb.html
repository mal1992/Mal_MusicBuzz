    This week , I explored around Angular js . I have implemented the angular filter in one of the experiments. Another experiment deals with how it can retreive data from an APi
    using $scope. From simple experiemnts to complex ones have been traversed in this week so a lot of learning was involved . Especiall when i had to us $http 
    in the js file.
