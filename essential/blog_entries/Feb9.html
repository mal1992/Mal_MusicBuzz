<h3>Moving into Level 2 of Jquery :D </h3>

<p>
    Goal for this week: Simple Jquery elements to form a complex Experiment !
</p>

<p>
    So my idea for this week , was to start with simple jquery animations and functions so that I can combine all of the amazingness into one big experiment. So you would be noticing few simple jquery experiments followed by a 
    slightly complex experiment which would combine all basic experiments that i had worked on :D
