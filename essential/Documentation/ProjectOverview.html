            <h3>How this idea came up</h3>
            <p>
                Whenever I wanted to check out details about my favourite artist , i used to go to usatoday.com to get the news about them,
                gossipusa.com to see their latest review and wikipedia to see their basic info . This inspired me to create a website where I placed all the components
                together so its easier for users to navigate and get what they want.
