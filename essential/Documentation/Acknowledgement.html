            <p> <b>CS5610: Web Development </b> is one of the most practice oriented courses that I have taken in my masters program. Learning by experimenting has been a great experience, under the guidance of eminent faculty.
            First I want to thank <i style="color:red">Prof Richard Rasala</i> for such a well-organized course! The wealth of resources provided in just Prof. Rasala’s home page and the web development course page is enough to take us through the entire course. In addition to these, the regular email updates and valuable suggestions and guidelines helped me a lot throughout the course.
            </p><p>
            Finally, my Teaching Assistant <i style="color:red">Pruthvi Kumar Reddy</i> has been a constant source of inspiration and encouragement throughout the semester. The weekly reviews and feedbacks were immensely helpful in keeping me on track.
